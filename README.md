# A-Rapid-GeoSAM-Based-Workflow-for-Multi-Temporal-Glacier-Delineation
GeoSAM-based workflow for rapid, multi-temporal glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 imagery. Combines late-summer compositing, spectral ice detection, prompt-guided segmentation, and post-processing to produce consistent glacier outlines for change analysis.
